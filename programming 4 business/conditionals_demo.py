# Example 1:
# Write a program to print even and odd numbers from the range of 1 to 10.

# Example 2:
# Write a function to ask user to input monthly income and
# tax the declared monthly income based on:

        # 0 to less than 3000, give a zero tax to the income.
        # 3000 to less than 5000, tax 1.5% of the income.
        # 5000 to less than 8000, tax 2.5% of the income.
        # 8000 to less than 10000, tax 3.5% of the income.
        # greater than or equal 10000, tax 5%  of the income.

# Example 3:
# Write a function to ask user to input monthly income.
# The function will check if user enter an integer or float data type.
# It will loop endlessly to ask user to enter the correct data type.
